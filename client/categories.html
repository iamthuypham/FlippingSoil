          <h2>If I am not in the land business can I purchase from you anyway?</h2>
          <p>Absolutely! Although we often sell to established real estate investors, we have found that some of our best customers are new to this business. Please feel free to email or call us to talk about your interest in rural land.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>What kind of payments are accepted?</h2>
          <p>I accept cashier’s or certified check, money order, wire transfer, credit or debit card, and electronic bank transfer (ACH).</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>May I set up a payment plan/financing?</h2>
          <p>Most likely, yes! if a payment plan is <em>not</em> detailed in the listing, please contact me and I will try to come up with a win-win solution. In a payment plan, you pay a down payment and we both sign a land contract that spells out your monthly payment. The property is then yours to use. When the price is paid in full, I grant you the property with a deed.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>How do I qualify for a payment plan?</h2>
          <p>If you are interested in the property and believe you can make payments then you qualify. You don’t need a credit check or even have to be American. If your circumstances change along the way please let us know so I can work with you. I want you to use the property and enjoy it–then show and tell your friends how you got your land from us so they can too.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Why do you sometimes offer two different prices, depending on whether the payment is up front or financed?</h2>
          <p>Often, I would prefer to sell certain properties for cash quickly. When that is the case, I discount the cash price to make it more attractive to you.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Can you hold a property for me?</h2>
          <p>To be fair to everyone, my properties are sold first come, first served. If you want me to hold the property for 7 days, while you get together your payment, I charge a $100 fee. This $100 will be applied to your purchase, if you go ahead and buy the property.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>How does the sale process work?</h2>
          <p>You need to tell me how you want the deed titled and what mailing address want for the deed and taxes. Once the purchase price is paid in full, I prepare a Grant Deed or acceptable high quality deed to officially transfer ownership to you and have it notarized. You don’t need to sign anything. I send the new deed to you and you own the land! The deed must then be recorded with the county.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Why should I buy from you instead of a real estate agent?</h2>
          <p>Often, I would prefer to sell certain properties for cash quickly. When that is the case, I discount the cash price to make it more attractive to you.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>How is the deed recorded?</h2>
          <p>In most cases, I ask you to record the deed. It’s pretty simple, and I’ll send instructions when I send you the deed. Usually you pay the county a recording fee (about $16-50 depending on number of pages in the deed) and transfer taxes (55 cents and up; each county has &nbsp;transfer tax schedule based on the value of the land). &nbsp;In California, there’s one more step: the buyer needs to fill out and sign a form called Preliminary Change of Ownership Report; I will send you instructions on how to do this.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>How should I title the property?</h2>
          <p>There are all kinds of ways to own a property. <a href="http://www.firstam.com/assets/homebuilder/homebuyer/vesting-ways-to-take-title.pdf" target="_blank">First American Title</a> does a good job of explaining some of the common ways</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Can I buy land in my kids’ names?</h2>
          <p>Yes, one of the nice things about transferring land in the US is that the buyer does not have to sign. The seller signs as the grantor granting the property to the Grantee or receiver of the grant. A child not of age to sign legally binding contracts does not need to sign to receive or take ownership of land. They might have a hard time selling it until they are of age.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Are there back taxes or liens associated with the property?</h2>
          <p>Unless otherwise stated, all of our properties are free, clear and current at the time of conveyance. A few properties may have delinquent taxes, so please see the tax information section in each individual listing.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>What else can you tell me about the property?</h2>
          <p>I purchase real property for the sole purpose of re-selling it. &nbsp;<em>Everything</em> I know about each parcel is stated in the listing.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>May I go tour the property before I buy it?</h2>
          <p>Yes, please do. Some land you can drive right up to and others need some tenacity and ingenuity. With GPS coordinates and a modern phone or some research on the internet ahead of time you should be able to go look and see the land for yourself. You don’t need to ask me, just go. Lots of buyers call me from the land and buy it during their tour.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Do we need to meet in person?</h2>
          <p>No! The entire process is done remotely. We do it by phone, mail, fax, and email.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Does the property have utilities?</h2>
          <p>Unless indicated in the description, the rural properties I represent do not have utilities. They’re perfect for a solar or wind-powered “green getaway.”</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Are mineral rights included?</h2>
          <p>Mineral rights are usually not included. I have never found this to be an issue with any of the properties I have sold.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>If I am not in the United States may I still buy land from you?</h2>
          <p>Yes, American land can be bought by anyone who is not subject to American trade restrictions like citizens of North Korea, Myanmar, Cuba and a handful of other countries.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Do I need a real estate agent or attorney to buy or sell land?</h2>
          <p>No, but they sure do a lot of marketing to make you think so. Real estate agents tend to market land for what it might be worth if the right buyer comes along some day. I market land for a quick sale, excluding their fees to get the end user the best price. May I raise crops or animals on the property? Probably but each property has its own local restrictions. You should check local zoning first.&nbsp;</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>May I raise crops or animals on the property?</h2>
          <p>Probably but each property has its own local restrictions. You should check local zoning first.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>May I put a trailer (or other structure) on the land?</h2>
          <p>Hopefully, but you really need to ask the local zoning. I don’t care what you put on the land as long as it is within zoning guidelines. Get creative with it!</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Will you give me a tour?</h2>
          <p>No, I’m not a real estate agent trying to pry a commission out of you to pay for a financed car to drive you around in. Use your cell phone to look up the GPS coordinates to the property. Download a free app that shows you the actual coordinates.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Do you have any pictures of the land?</h2>
          <p>Sometimes I hire someone to go take pictures, but I started noticing that someone often buys the land before I get the pictures from the person I hired to go get them. If you are touring my properties please take pictures. I will compensate you for good pictures. Try to get the road or lack thereof. The view in all directions and anything you think is noteworthy good or bad.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Can we use escrow to close?</h2>
          <p>Sure, if you pay for it. Signing over a deed is really easy so I have a hard time paying someone else to do something I know how to do and have done many times.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Do you offer title insurance?</h2>
          <p>Sure, if you pay for it. Sometimes it makes financial sense, and sometimes it doesn’t. If you’re buying a low dollar value property, and the policy you find costs several hundred dollars, it might not be worth it. Especially since title policies have a lot of exclusions in the fine print, and you might find that the title issues you’re worried about aren’t even being covered. When I purchase properties myself for resale, sometimes I buy title insurance policies but more often than not, I don’t. If I do have title insurance on a property I’m selling, it will be noted in the listing. What’s great is that when you buy land without a mortgage you don’t have to be taken to the cleaners by the title insurance companies.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>Do you own any other property in the area or right next door?</h2>
          <p>The way I buy property so cheap is I don’t get to choose which properties I am buying. I buy what people want to sell for cash right away. What I can do is offer you names and mailing address of the neighbors to land you buy so you can solicit them to buy their property too or gain better access or whatever you have in mind.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>What does due diligence mean?</h2>
          <p>Prospective buyers are urged to examine and research all properties prior to buying or making an offer to purchase. Contact any state or county offices, utility companies, homeowners’ associations and other relevant organizations before making an offer to purchase or placing a down payment. By buying you are acknowledging that you have completed all due diligence and that you understand the legal commitment to purchase. All land parcels are sold “as-is, where is.” All information contained in our land for sale listings has come from reliable sources or prior owners of the subject properties and is accurate to the best of our knowledge. However, I make no guarantee expressed or implied as to the location, condition, accessibility, terrain, build ability or information contained in these property listings. Sizes advertised are approximate. For many of the land listings on TheLandStop.com, I use GPS maps. This GPS maps information is for the purpose of locating your property only. Prior to building a fence or any structures on your land, you should contact a state licensed surveyor to mark the exact corners of your property or to get a property survey done in the county the property is located in.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h2>What kind of guarantees can you offer?</h2>
          <p>I want happy customers, so if there is something wrong at any step in the process, even after you’ve purchased, contact us right away and I will do my best to make it right. And finally… We have spent a lot of time and energy making this as simple and easy for our customers as possible. Contact us so we can establish a relationship — we are happy to answer your questions.</p>
